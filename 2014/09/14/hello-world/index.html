              <p> Hello everyone. I'm going to be relaunching this blog over the next few days. This is the first post in that effort. </p>

<p> It'll be mostly programming related (Python, Git, Emacs, RSS, etc.) but I may occassionally dabble with some political stuff. We'll see. </p>

<p> I'm writing this post in Emacs and will be posting it with org2blog/wp. I like this system and how it feels. Honestly, it reminds me a bit of a simplified World Outline (something I have got to write about in the future). </p>

<p> I think I may need a new title for this blog. Is it lame for a programmer to use Wordpress? I can't help but think it is but all the yak shaving required to build my own or use an existing flat-file system was just too boring for me to enjoy. I will say this: Wordpress knows how to build blogging software. You don't get to where they are unless you know what you're doing. </p>

<p> One thing I'm going to work on in writing this blog is to just get the words out there. I find I agonize for too long over getting the words precisely right instead of putting it out there. So what if there are a few errors? In this very paragraph I've wanted to keep going back and rewrite something but down that road is dragons. Not to say I won't go back and clean this up, I just need to separate "writing" from "editing" a bit more forcefully. </p>

<p> I think good bloggers have that natural ability but I don't yet. I have the mind of an editor, not a blogger. But I think with practice I can fix that. At this stage I need to focus on churning out content rather than making sure what I put out is flawless. Let's face it: I have basically zero name recognition in the programming world. I've put a few projects up on Github but for the most part I just bounce along the rocky bottom of the Python world. But that's okay. It gives me a chance to keep improving myself in the hopes that one day people will know who I am and what I can do. </p>

<p> So far so good on not going back and re-writing/re-reading everything. Just keep busting out words. I'll go back over this once and fix any really bad typos but for the most part I want this to be what Dave Winer intended for blogging to be: "the unedited voice of a person." Man, what a great description. Hopefully I can live up to it and not let this blog wither on the vine again like I've done approximately three dozen times already. </p>

<p> Anything else? Don't think so. Still need to come up with a post title. Need to make sure org2blog handles source code well. </p>
