              <p>The design specs for a new WordPress theme I&rsquo;m building call for an
angled background:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-0.png"></p>

<p>This one took awhile to figure this one out so &mdash; to borrow a
classic tech blog motto &mdash; I&rsquo;m writing the post I wish I had
found when I started down this path.</p>

<hr />

<p>My initial searches of how other people have solved this led to a lot
of recommendations of stuff like <code>transform</code>, <code>skewY</code>, <code>clip-path</code>,
and psuedo-selectors.</p>

<p>While it was fun to kick the tires on some of the new, advanced
features CSS has developed in recent years, each attempt either ended
with a ton of code smell or I would discover browser support was
limited and therefore not a viable solution.</p>

<hr />

<p>I decided to scrap all the advanced trickery and return to basics.</p>

<p>The thing I&rsquo;m working on is a background, therefore I decided to focus
on the CSS <code>background</code> property. Is there a widely-used <code>background</code>
property which starts as one color and finishes as another? Why, yes
there is: <code>linear-gradient()</code>.</p>

<p>I first put together the most basic gradient I could think of, just to
guage viability of using <code>linear-gradient()</code> for this.</p>

<p><code>background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #22313F, #F4F4F4)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-1.png"></p>

<p>Not bad! The color proportions are off, the angle is wrong, and the
transition is too gradual &mdash; but this was offering the best
solution yet.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first change I made was to have the dark blue extend further down.</p>

<p>A percentage or length after a color tells the gradient that the color
should reach its apex at that position.</p>

<p><code>background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #22313F 70%, #F4F4F4)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-2.png"></p>

<p>With 0% being the start of a background, and 100% being the end of a
background.</p>

<p>This tells the gradient to blend from the starting color until 70% of
the background has been covered at which point <code>#22313F</code> is at its
apex.</p>

<p>This achieved the desired effect because the first color is also the
starting color, leading to the solid color at the top (which I
wanted).</p>

<p>The next color in the list, <code>#F4F4F4</code> starts at 70% and reaches its
apex at 100% (hence why it is less solid than the dark blue.)</p>

<p>Still need to sharpen that dividing line, but it&rsquo;s coming along.</p>

<hr />

<p>The second change I made was to have the angle slightly tilted.</p>

<p><code>background-image: linear-gradient(176deg, #22313F 70%, #F4F4F4)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-3.png"></p>

<p>&ldquo;to bottom&rdquo; is equivalent to <code>180deg</code> and from there it was just a
matter of finding an angle that matched the spec.</p>

<hr />

<p>Getting a sharp transition between the two colors took the longest
time to figure out.</p>

<p>Everything clicked once I realized I just needed the apex of <code>#F4F4F4</code>
to <em>also</em> occur at 70% of the background image. That way it would be a
solid color (<code>#22313F</code>) from 0% to 70% and another solid color
(<code>#F4F4F4</code>) from 70% to 100%.</p>

<p><code>background-image: linear-gradient(176deg, #22313F 70%, #F4F4F4 70%)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-4.png"></p>

<p>So close! But those jagged edges obviously wouldn&rsquo;t fly so I had to
keep at it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I eventually stumbled upon
a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40261626">Stack Overflow answer</a> that
provided the missing piece.</p>

<p><code style="font-size: 14px;">
background-image: linear-gradient(176deg, #22313F 70%, #F4F4F4
calc(70% + 2px))
</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018/css-angled-background-0.png"></p>

<p>The reason <code>calc(70% + 2px)</code> worked while <code>70%</code> didn&rsquo;t is that <code>70%</code>
provided absolutely zero gradation between the two colors.</p>

<p>What <code>calc(70% + 2px)</code> provides is a very, very small amount of
gradation between the two colors which the eye perceives as a sharp
transition without it being jagged.</p>

<p>So <code>#22313F</code> starts at 0% and reaches its apex at 70%. Then, <code>#F4F4F4</code>
reaches <em>its</em> apex at 70% plus two pixels and continuing to 100%.</p>

<p>So those there is still a gradient &mdash; it&rsquo;s just a two pixel
gradient from dark blue to light gray.</p>
